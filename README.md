The scene that I was going for for this homework assignment was a office room where it was more of a room for work. 
The objects that I put in the scene are mostly office supplies and furnitures. For this particular scene, I was kinda 
inspired of how my future work space will look like. The main character for this scene is a man, who is residing in this
workspace. 

List of objects in the scene:
- HumanMale (Player Model)
- Books (desk)
- Floor lamp
